## Client 
Shane – Wesfarmers Chemicals, Energy, and Fertilisers (WESCEF) 

## Problem Statement 
Traditional service desk ticketing systems are often slow and inconvenient for both client and IT technicians. Sometimes basic requests such as resetting a password takes days to complete! This is due to several factors including: 
- Clients cannot get help of business hours. 
- Long delays in response from both parties. 
- Unclear or lack of information to complete a request. 
- Approval is required before service can be completed. 
In addition, these inefficiencies prevent IT technicians from completing more complex requests in a timely manner. They often find themselves bogged down by the sheer volume of routine and time-consuming tasks. 

## Proposed Solution 
WESCEF wants to create a an intelligent chatbot for the service desk analysts that allows the user to query the knowledge bases and identify self-help mechanisms. The chatbot is to be called “Ask WESly” and have the following features: 
- An application for clients to conveniently request a service^ and instantly receive a response. A response may be a link to a self-help article or further questions if not enough information was provided.  
- A portal for IT technicians in which requests are automatically classified into priority. 
- If the chatbot is unable to fulfil the clients request, then the ticket is escalated to a real person.   
- The chatbot should automatically email authorised individuals for tickets that require approval for example loaning hardware. 

## Footnotes
^ a service may be hardware request, installing software on a computer, troubleshooting software or hardware issues, request access to a resource, etc.
